# Tokenization-of-Malayalam-Language-Using-Python-For-spaCy
s paCy is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython. spaCy is a relatively new package for “Industrial strength NLP in Python” developed by Matt Honnibal at Explosion AI. Tokenisation is a foundational step in many NLP tasks. Tokenising text is the process of splitting a piece of text into words, symbols, punctuation, spaces and other elements, thereby creating “tokens”. In this project we tried to implement spaCy in Malayalam and perform the task of tokenization. We created datasets, necessary files, performed cythonization to achieve this.
